        <h2>7. Explicit Risk Notes</h2>
        <div class="high-risk">
            <p>The following risk notes should be reviewed by the proposal team:</p>
            
        <div class="risk-note">
            <strong>Unanswered Requirement (Row 24)</strong>
            <p>Row 24 (&#x27;Create a procurement plan against a project&#x27;) has no availability code and only a &#x27;Not Clear&#x27; comment. This is the only unanswered item in the tab and represents a significant gap. D365 F&amp;O natively supports project procurement planning — this should be marked &#x27;S&#x27; with a clear explanation. Leaving it unanswered may cause the evaluator to assume the system does not support this capability, which would be incorrect and potentially disqualifying for this section.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <strong>Modification Classifications May Be Overstated (Rows 21, 27)</strong>
            <p>Two items are marked &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification) where D365 F&amp;O built-in Alert Rules and Workflow Notifications could address the requirements with configuration only. Overstating the need for modifications increases perceived implementation cost and effort, which may negatively affect scoring. These should be reviewed for potential reclassification to &#x27;S&#x27; or &#x27;W&#x27;.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <strong>MS Project Integration Dependency (Row 35)</strong>
            <p>The MS Project integration response is correct but should explicitly mention the dependency on the Microsoft Project Client Add-in. Without this qualifier, the client may assume native browser-based MS Project integration, which is not how D365 F&amp;O delivers this capability. Failure to set proper expectations could lead to post-implementation disputes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <strong>Assessment Sheets Capability (Row 37)</strong>
            <p>Marking &#x27;Project Assessment Sheets&#x27; as &#x27;S&#x27; may overstate the out-of-the-box capability. D365 F&amp;O does not have pre-built, structured multi-departmental assessment templates with KB/lessons learned. While the building blocks exist (Questionnaires, Document Management, Notes), assembly of a complete assessment sheet solution requires configuration effort. This should be disclosed to avoid scope disputes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <strong>Travel Timesheet Specifics (Row 39)</strong>
            <p>While D365 F&amp;O timesheets and expense management cover the core requirements, specific fields for arrival/departure times are not standard timesheet line fields. Minor form customization may be needed. The &#x27;S&#x27; marking is defensible but should include a qualifying note.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Verification Gaps</h2>
        <div class="medium-risk">
            <p>The following areas require additional verification before finalizing the response:</p>

            <td>The validation assumes D365 F&amp;O Alert Rules can fully meet the &#x27;automatic alerts on due dates&#x27; requirement (Row 21). This should be verified by testing alert rule creation on project task due date fields to confirm the specific trigger events are available out of the box.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><strong>MS Project Add-in Compatibility</strong></td>
            <td>Row 35 assumes the MS Project Client Add-in is still supported and compatible with the client&#x27;s intended D365 F&amp;O version. Microsoft has been evolving this integration. Verify the current state of the add-in and whether Project for the Web or Project Operations may be the recommended path.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><strong>Questionnaire Module Suitability</strong></td>
            <td>The suggestion to use D365 F&amp;O Questionnaires for assessment sheets (Row 37) assumes the module can handle multi-departmental routing and structured data capture. The Questionnaires module may have limitations for complex workflows. Verify suitability or evaluate Power Apps as an alternative.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><strong>Timesheet Custom Fields</strong></td>
            <td>Row 39 assumes arrival/departure time fields can be added to timesheets with minor customization. Verify whether timesheet line extensions are supported in the client&#x27;s target D365 F&amp;O version and whether this falls within standard configuration or requires developer effort.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><strong>Project Procurement Workflow</strong></td>
            <td>While Row 24 is recommended to be &#x27;S&#x27;, the specific procurement planning workflow the client envisions (procurement plan vs. individual purchase requisitions) should be clarified. D365 F&amp;O supports item requirements and purchase requisitions against projects, but a formal &#x27;procurement plan&#x27; document as a consolidated planning view may require Power BI or custom reporting.</td>
