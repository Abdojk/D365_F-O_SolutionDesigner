        <div class="summary">
            <p><strong>Tab Status:</strong> Partially completed — Only 16 of 104 requirements have availability codes. Validation performed on answered items; gap analysis performed on unanswered items.</p>
            <p><strong>Total Requirements Identified:</strong> 104 (excluding header rows and blank rows)</p>
            <p><strong>Answered (with availability code):</strong> 16 rows (R4–R21, codes S or M)</p>
            <p><strong>Unanswered (no availability code):</strong> 88 rows (R16–R120, across all remaining sections)</p>

            <p>This tab covers Quotation/Proposal Creation, Sales Orders, Pricing, Order Modifications, Commissions, Sales Analysis, and Reporting. Only the Quotation/Proposal Creation section (R4–R21) has been partially answered. The remaining ~88 requirements spanning Sales Orders, Pricing, Invoicing, Commissions, Analysis, and Reporting are entirely unanswered — representing the single largest compliance gap in this workbook.</p>

        <h2>2. High-Risk Items</h2>

        <div class="critical-banner">
            <strong>CRITICAL: 88 Requirements Are Completely Unanswered</strong>
            <p>Per the RFP Instructions tab: "Items that are not addressed by the Vendor's response will be assumed as not available or not supported by the Vendor's proposed solution." This means 88 requirements — spanning Sales Orders, Pricing, Order Modifications, Commissions, Sales Analysis, and Reporting — will be contractually treated as "Not Available." Many of these capabilities ARE available in D365 F&amp;O, making this an enormous missed opportunity and contractual liability.</p>

                <li>Assign appropriate availability codes (S, W, M, 3, or N).</li>
                <li>Add explanatory comments, especially for M and 3 classifications.</li>

        <h2>7. Explicit Risk Notes</h2>
        <div class="high-risk">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Catastrophic Response Gap:</strong> 88 of 104 requirements (85%) in this tab have no availability code. Per RFP instructions, all unanswered items are assumed "Not Available." This means the vendor's response effectively states that D365 F&amp;O cannot handle sales orders, pricing, order modifications, commissions, sales analysis, or reporting — which is fundamentally incorrect and contractually devastating.</li>
                <li><strong>Core ERP Strength Unrepresented:</strong> Sales Order Management, Pricing, and Reporting are among D365 F&amp;O's strongest functional areas. Leaving these unanswered while competitors will likely mark them as Standard represents a critical competitive disadvantage.</li>
                <li><strong>R5 Misclassification:</strong> Auto-populating customer data on proposals is marked as 'M' (Modification) when it is standard D365 F&amp;O functionality. This understates the platform's capability and may create unnecessary cost expectations for the client.</li>
                <li><strong>Overstatement Risk on R14 and R18:</strong> 'Rich proposal packages' (R14) and 'Automated estimation cost sheets' (R18) are marked as 'S' but may not fully meet the requirement scope without additional configuration. Comments should be added to set accurate expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Commission Tracking Gap:</strong> The Commission Structure section (R56-R57) and commission-related items in Sales Analysis (R95-R97) are all unanswered. D365 F&amp;O has a Commission module, but split commissions and payment-based commissions may require configuration.</li>
                <li><strong>No Comments Provided:</strong> None of the answered rows include explanatory comments. The RFP instructions "strongly encourage" vendors to add comments. The absence of comments weakens the response even for correctly classified items.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Verification Gaps</h2>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R25 (Import DFI to Offer):</strong> "DFI" (Data for Inquiry) is a Technica-specific term not mapped to standard ERP terminology. Cannot verify D365 F&amp;O capability without understanding the DFI format and business process. Requires client clarification.</li>
                <li><strong>R27 (DFI internal workflow and confirmation from Client):</strong> Same dependency on DFI process definition. D365 F&amp;O has workflow capabilities, but whether they match the DFI process cannot be verified without specifications.</li>
                <li><strong>R31 (Automated control points for offer selling price and delivery time):</strong> The requirement references formula-based automatic calculation across engineering, manufacturing, assembly, testing, shipping, and costing. D365 F&amp;O has components addressing each area, but the "automated estimation" combining all into a single quotation output depends entirely on implementation design. Cannot fully verify without understanding current estimation methodology.</li>
                <li><strong>R48 (Complementary product prompting):</strong> D365 F&amp;O has cross-sell/up-sell suggestions but the depth of "complementary product prompting during order entry" depends on product data setup. Cannot verify completeness without product catalog review.</li>
                <li><strong>R53 (Complete integration between Sales and Manufacturing):</strong> D365 F&amp;O integrates sales and manufacturing via MRP/production orders, but "complete integration" is subjective. The scope of integration expected by Technica cannot be verified without detailed process mapping.</li>
                <li><strong>R80-R82 (Invoice by assembly, BOM split, CAD export):</strong> These are engineering-to-finance integration requirements specific to Technica's manufacturing process. D365 F&amp;O has BOM and project invoicing, but the CAD-to-BOM export workflow depends on CAD system and integration approach. Cannot verify without technical architecture review.</li>
                <li><strong>R116-R118 (Suppliers machines, competition analysis):</strong> These appear to be CRM/competitive intelligence requirements. D365 F&amp;O does not have native competitive analysis features. These would likely require Dynamics 365 Sales (CRM) or a third-party solution. Verification requires clarification of expected functionality.</li>
