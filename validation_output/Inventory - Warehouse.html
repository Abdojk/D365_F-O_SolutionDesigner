            <p>The Inventory - Warehouse tab covers Inventory Control, Warehouse/Distribution,
            Receiving/Shipping, and Reporting. The majority of responses are marked as 'S' (Standard),
            which is broadly consistent with D365 F&amp;O Supply Chain Management and Warehouse Management
            capabilities. However, several critical items in the Electronic Data Collection section
            (R59-R62) are left completely unanswered, and a few items marked 'M' (Modification) may
            be achievable through standard D365 F&amp;O configuration. One item (R85 Leasing Equipments)
            marked 'S' may be inaccurately classified depending on the requirement's intent.</p>

        <h2>7. Explicit Risk Notes</h2>
        <div class="high-risk">
            <ul>
<li><strong>Electronic Data Collection (R59-R62) entirely unanswered:</strong> Four consecutive requirements related to electronic data collection, barcoding, and RF devices have no availability codes. Per the RFP Instructions tab, 'Items that are not addressed by the Vendor's response will be assumed as not available or not supported.' D365 F&amp;O Warehouse Management provides all of these capabilities as standard features. Leaving them unanswered creates significant contractual risk and unnecessarily weakens the proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Product Groups to Profit Center (R63) unanswered:</strong> This requirement has no availability code. D365 F&amp;O supports this through item group financial dimension defaults and posting profiles. The omission creates an unnecessary gap.</li>
<li><strong>Job costing reports (R97) unanswered:</strong> A reporting requirement covering subcontractors and expenses by job/customer is left without an availability code. D365 F&amp;O Project Accounting provides comprehensive job costing as standard. This is a missed opportunity to demonstrate platform strength.</li>
<li><strong>Shipment list dismantling (R75) unanswered:</strong> No response provided for a standard WMS capability. Creates unnecessary risk.</li>
<li><strong>Leasing Equipments (R85) potentially misclassified:</strong> Marked as 'S' but the requirement may refer to inventory equipment leasing rather than financial lease accounting. If the client means tracking equipment loaned out, this is NOT standard in D365 F&amp;O and could lead to scope disputes during implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Items marked 'M' that may be standard:</strong> Several items (R93: BOL/pick tickets online, R105-R106: item consumption by project) are marked as requiring modification but may be achievable through standard D365 F&amp;O configuration. This understates the platform's capabilities and may increase perceived implementation cost.</li>
<li><strong>Item Creation workflow (R17) marked 'M':</strong> D365 F&amp;O Product Lifecycle Management includes configurable approval workflows. Marking this as 'M' may overstate the customization needed, potentially disadvantaging the proposal against competitors who classify it correctly.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>8. Verification Gaps</h2>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <ul>
<li><strong>R85 (Leasing Equipments):</strong> The requirement is ambiguous. 'Leasing Equipments' could refer to financial lease accounting (standard via Asset Leasing module) or inventory equipment leasing/tracking (not standard). Cannot verify accuracy of the 'S' classification without client clarification on the intended scope.</li>
<li><strong>R75 (Ability to dismantle shipment list):</strong> The term 'dismantle' is non-standard. D365 F&amp;O supports splitting/reorganizing shipments, but the exact intent (remove specific items, split into multiple shipments, cancel partial shipment) needs clarification to confirm the appropriate availability code.</li>
<li><strong>R93 (Receive acknowledgements, bill-of-lading, pick tickets online):</strong> The term 'acknowledgements' is vague. BOL and pick tickets are standard WMS features. The 'acknowledgements' component needs clarification &mdash; it may refer to ASN (Advanced Shipping Notices) which are also standard, or to a specific client process.</li>
<li><strong>R100 (Automatic shipping report):</strong> The requirement includes specific fields (on-time delivery, out-of-stock). While D365 F&amp;O has shipping reports and Transportation Management analytics, the exact combination of all specified fields in a single automated report needs implementation-level verification.</li>
<li><strong>R63 (Product Groups assigned to Profit Center):</strong> The exact mapping mechanism desired by the client is unclear. D365 F&amp;O supports financial dimension defaults on item groups, but the client may expect a direct parent-child relationship structure that differs from the dimension-based approach.</li>
