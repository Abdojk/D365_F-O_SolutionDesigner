        <h2>7. Explicit Risk Notes</h2>
        <div class="high-risk">
            <ul>
<li>Multiple requirements are left unanswered (no availability code). Per the RFP Instructions tab, 'Items that are not addressed by the Vendor\'s response will be assumed as not available or not supported.' This creates significant contractual risk.</li><li>Several items marked as 'M' (Modification) may be achievable through standard D365 F&O configuration, potentially understating the platform\'s capabilities.</li><li>The 'Not Clear' responses on critical items (cash requirements planning, AP-Purchasing integration) leave gaps that competitors may exploit.</li><li>Invoice email capabilities are incorrectly marked as 'M' when they are standard D365 F&O features via Print Management — this may convey an incorrect impression of complexity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Verification Gaps</h2>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <ul>
<li>R68 (Exception reporting on items that cannot be invoiced): Requirement is ambiguous. Cannot verify without client clarification.</li><li>R101 (Price matrix / invoicing coordinator process): Business process requirement that depends on implementation design. Cannot verify against standard D365 F&amp;O without further context.</li><li>R160 (Bank correspondence reference list): Non-standard terminology. Cannot map to specific D365 F&amp;O feature without clarification.</li>
