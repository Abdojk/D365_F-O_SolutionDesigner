            <p>The Purchasing tab covers the full procurement lifecycle including Purchase Requisitions, RFQs, Purchase Orders, vendor quotations, receiving, invoice matching, vendor management, and logistics coordination. The majority of responses (65 of 74) are marked as 'S' (Standard), which is broadly consistent with D365 F&O Procurement &amp; Sourcing module capabilities. However, one critical row (R16) is left unanswered, several 'M' classifications may overstate the required effort, and the complete absence of vendor comments across all rows limits verification of response accuracy.</p>

  <td>Need capabilities to determine which items generate variance / replacement</td>
  <td><strong>Not Provided</strong></td>
  <td><em>No comment</em></td>
  <td>NO availability code provided. This requirement asks for capabilities to determine which items generate variance or need replacement. This is a critical gap — leaving it unanswered implies &#x27;Not Available&#x27; per the Instructions tab. D365 F&amp;O does provide purchase price variance tracking via standard costing and can identify items with price deviations through variance reports and the costing sheet. Replacement item tracking could leverage superseded/substitute item functionality.</td>
  <td>Must provide an availability code. Recommend &#x27;W&#x27; or &#x27;S&#x27; with comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O standard costing identifies items generating purchase price variance.

  <td>Marked &#x27;W&#x27; (Workaround). D365 F&amp;O can auto-receive via warehouse management policies, automatic product receipt posting upon arrival registration, or through manufacturing execution backflush. The &#x27;W&#x27; classification is reasonable but could arguably be &#x27;S&#x27; depending on the specific scenario (e.g., WMS arrival journals with auto-posting).</td>
  <td>Consider whether &#x27;S&#x27; is more appropriate. If the use case is receiving components upon PO arrival, D365 F&amp;O product receipt posting with warehouse arrival journal qualifies as standard. Recommend adding a clarifying comment.</td>

  <td><strong>M</strong></td>
  <td><em>No comment</em></td>
  <td>Marked &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification). However, D365 F&amp;O provides Purchase Agreement terms and conditions, and Print Management supports adding standard terms text to PO printouts. Document handling can attach T&amp;C templates. The &#x27;M&#x27; classification likely overstates the required effort.</td>
  <td>Consider reclassifying to &#x27;W&#x27; or &#x27;S&#x27;. D365 F&amp;O Purchase Agreements support terms and conditions fields. Print Management can include standard T&amp;C text on purchase order confirmations. If the requirement is for T&amp;C stored at the vendor master level, standard vendor notes/document attachments achieve this without code changes.</td>

  <td>Marked &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification). D365 F&amp;O has Document Handling and Print Management that can store and attach Terms &amp; Conditions documents. SSRS report customization can embed T&amp;C text blocks. A library of reusable T&amp;C templates could be achieved through document types and document attachments without custom code.</td>
  <td>Consider reclassifying to &#x27;W&#x27;. D365 F&amp;O Document Handling supports a library of attachable documents. Print Management report formatting can include T&amp;C sections. If a formal selectable T&amp;C library with version control is required, &#x27;M&#x27; may be appropriate, but basic T&amp;C printing is achievable via configuration.</td>

  <td>Vendor lead times and Penalty setup</td>
  <td><strong>S</strong></td>
  <td><em>No comment</em></td>
  <td>Marked &#x27;S&#x27; (Standard). D365 F&amp;O supports vendor lead times as standard (configurable on item coverage, trade agreements, and vendor-item combinations). However, &#x27;Penalty setup&#x27; for late deliveries is NOT a standard D365 F&amp;O feature. There is no out-of-the-box penalty calculation or automatic penalty invoice generation. The &#x27;S&#x27; classification overstates the capability for the penalty portion.</td>
  <td>Reclassify to &#x27;S&#x27; for lead times only, with a comment noting: &#x27;Vendor lead times are standard in D365 F&amp;O via item coverage and trade agreements. Penalty setup for late deliveries requires customization (M) — D365 F&amp;O does not include standard penalty calculation or automatic debit note generation for delivery delays.&#x27;</td>

  <td><strong>S</strong></td>
  <td><em>No comment</em></td>
  <td>Marked &#x27;S&#x27; (Standard). D365 F&amp;O allows procurement users to view purchase order statuses and delivery remainders. However, the specific requirement of checking &#x27;pending invoices not yet issued by the Finance team for shipping purposes&#x27; is a cross-functional visibility need. While PO status inquiry is standard, a dedicated view linking unpaid vendor invoices to shipment release may require workspace customization or a saved view.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;S&#x27; but add clarifying comment: &#x27;Purchase order status inquiry and delivery remainder tracking are standard. For specific visibility into pending invoices blocking shipment, a custom workspace tile or saved inquiry view may be needed.&#x27;</td>

  <td><em>No comment</em></td>
  <td>Marked &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification). D365 F&amp;O Foreign Trade module provides Intrastat reporting, export/import compliance codes, commodity codes, and trade parameters by country. However, full shipping rules and regulations by country (e.g., hazmat rules, restricted goods lists, country-specific documentation) are not comprehensively covered out-of-the-box. &#x27;M&#x27; is a reasonable classification for comprehensive country-specific rule enforcement, though partial coverage exists.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;M&#x27; but add clarifying comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O Foreign Trade module provides commodity codes, Intrastat, and trade parameters by country. Full country-specific shipping rules (hazmat, restricted goods, documentation checklists) require additional configuration and possible customization. Consider 3rd-party trade compliance add-ons.&#x27;</td>

  <td><strong>M</strong></td>
  <td><em>No comment</em></td>
  <td>Marked &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification). D365 F&amp;O provides vendor evaluation and rating functionality, plus the ability to place vendors on hold (block for all transactions, invoicing, or requisitions). However, a formal assessment &#x27;checklist&#x27; with structured evaluation criteria and a blacklist workflow is not fully standard. The hold/block mechanism covers basic blacklisting, but a structured checklist-based assessment may require customization.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;M&#x27; but add clarifying comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O supports vendor hold/block (effective blacklisting) and vendor evaluation ratings as standard. A formal assessment checklist with structured criteria and approval workflow requires customization, though the Vendor Collaboration portal and questionnaires could partially address this need.&#x27;</td>

  <td>Marked &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification). This is a reasonable classification. D365 F&amp;O does not have a standard automated supplier reminder system for overdue deliveries or outstanding RFQ responses. While purchase order confirmations can be resent, proactive automated reminders based on delivery schedules or response deadlines require custom development.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;M&#x27;. Add comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O does not include standard automated supplier reminder functionality. PO confirmation can be resent manually via Print Management. Automated reminder workflows for overdue deliveries or pending RFQ responses require custom development using workflow notifications or Power Automate integration.&#x27;</td>

D365 F&amp;O does not have a standard negotiation log or structured negotiation recording feature for supplier discussions (forwarders, vessels). While notes and document attachments can be added to vendor records and purchase orders, a formal negotiation tracking module with structured fields is not standard.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;M&#x27;. Add comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O supports unstructured notes and document attachments on vendor records, POs, and RFQs. A formal negotiation log with structured fields (date, participants, terms discussed, outcomes) requires customization. Consider integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales for advanced relationship tracking.&#x27;</td>

However, a systematic &#x27;checklist&#x27; for verifying all required import documents (certificates of origin, customs declarations, inspection certificates, etc.) is not a standard feature. The requirement may need Document Management with a structured checklist approach.</td>
  <td>Consider &#x27;W&#x27; with comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O Document Handling supports document attachment tracking on purchase orders. Quality orders can verify incoming documentation. However, a comprehensive import document completeness checklist may require configuration of quality order test types or custom document tracking.&#x27;</td>

  <td>Marked &#x27;S&#x27; (Standard). D365 F&amp;O Master Planning handles supply and demand netting, and inventory reservation is standard. However, the specific scenario of &#x27;reserving extra ordered quantities (forecasted surplus) for new purchase requisitions&#x27; involves planned order pegging and supply-to-demand linking that requires careful MRP configuration. While achievable, it may not be straightforward &#x27;S&#x27;.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;S&#x27; but add comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O Master Planning calculates net requirements considering on-order quantities. Reservation of surplus supply against new demand is handled through planned order firming and pegging. Configuration of coverage rules and action messages required.&#x27;</td>

D365 F&amp;O does not provide a standard calendar/schedule overview dashboard showing all procurement requests across projects and countries for logistics planning. While individual inquiries exist (open PO list, delivery schedule), a consolidated visual calendar view requires customization or Power BI dashboard development.</td>
  <td>Keep &#x27;M&#x27;. Add comment: &#x27;D365 F&amp;O does not include a standard procurement calendar/schedule overview.

        <h2>7. Explicit Risk Notes</h2>
        <div class="high-risk">
            <p>The following risk notes highlight areas requiring immediate attention before RFP submission:</p>
            <div class="risk-note">
                <p><strong>Unanswered Requirement (R16) — Contractual Exposure</strong></p>
                <p>Row 16 (&#x27;Need capabilities to determine which items generate variance / replacement&#x27;) has no availability code. Per the RFP Instructions: &#x27;Items that are not addressed by the Vendor\&#x27;s response will be assumed as not available or not supported.&#x27; This creates a direct contractual risk where the client may assume the solution cannot identify variance-generating items, despite D365 F&amp;O having this capability through standard costing and variance reports.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="risk-note">
                <p><strong>Penalty Setup Overstated as Standard (R29)</strong></p>
                <p>Row 29 marks &#x27;Vendor lead times and Penalty setup&#x27; as &#x27;S&#x27; (Standard). While vendor lead times are indeed standard, penalty setup for late deliveries is not a D365 F&amp;O standard feature. If the client relies on the &#x27;S&#x27; classification to expect out-of-the-box penalty management, this creates a scope gap during implementation. The penalty portion should be clearly flagged as requiring customization.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="risk-note">
                <p><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions Potentially Over-Classified (R22, R23)</strong></p>
                <p>Rows 22 and 23 mark PO Terms &amp; Conditions and Printable T&amp;C Library as &#x27;M&#x27; (Modification). While customization may enhance the experience, basic T&amp;C functionality is available through D365 F&amp;O Print Management and Document Handling. Over-classifying as &#x27;M&#x27; may inflate implementation cost estimates unnecessarily and could lead to scope disputes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="risk-note">
                <p><strong>Cross-Functional Visibility Assumptions (R39, R68)</strong></p>
                <p>Rows 39 and 68 are marked &#x27;S&#x27; but involve cross-functional visibility that may require workspace configuration or saved views beyond default setup. While technically achievable without code, the implementation effort for proper configuration should be planned.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="risk-note">
                <p><strong>Import Document Compliance Gap (R68)</strong></p>
                <p>Row 68 requires checking availability of all documents for imported items. While D365 F&amp;O tracks documents, a systematic import compliance checklist is not standard. For organizations with significant import operations, this may require Quality Management configuration or a specialized trade compliance solution.</p>

        <h2>8. Verification Gaps</h2>
