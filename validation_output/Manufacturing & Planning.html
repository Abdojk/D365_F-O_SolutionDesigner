            <p>The Manufacturing &amp; Planning tab covers Factory Operations, Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Capacity Requirements Planning, Manufacturing Orders, and Routings. The majority of responses are marked as 'S' (Standard), which is broadly consistent with D365 F&amp;O's comprehensive manufacturing capabilities. However, several items in the Factory Operations and Manufacturing Orders sections are left unanswered (no availability code), and a few 'S' classifications in the Factory Operations section may overstate standard capabilities where Asset Management modules or custom development would be needed.</p>

<li><strong>Row 36:</strong> Add comment: Basic check-in/out and time tracking are standard. The specific calculation formulas for paint area and laser cut duration based on material thickness/dimensions may require custom route operation formulas or Engineering Change Management data integration.</li>
<li><strong>Row 109:</strong> Add comment: Standard overhead distribution via costing sheets is available. Project-size-based proration may require additional cost allocation rule configuration.</li>

                    <tr><td>R4</td><td>S (Standard)</td><td>W — D365 F&amp;O Production Control has work orders and operations but dedicated checklists per task require Asset Management or customization.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R5</td><td>S (Standard)</td><td>W — Team leader assignments as a distinct concept require custom roles and workflow beyond standard resource group assignment.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R7</td><td>S (Standard)</td><td>W — Production task checklists are not native to Production Control. Quality order tests or Asset Management checklists serve as workarounds.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R22</td><td>Not Provided (Not Clear)</td><td>Clarify requirement, then likely S — D365 F&amp;O can track loose/non-assembled parts via BOM line types and inventory management.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R26</td><td>Not Provided</td><td>W — D365 F&amp;O Quality Management supports quality order test reports, and Document Management can serve as a test report library.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R32</td><td>Not Provided</td><td>M — Bulk completion of multiple route operations simultaneously requires custom development in D365 F&amp;O.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R33</td><td>Not Provided</td><td>M — Same as R32; bulk update for surface treatment operations requires custom development.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R63</td><td>Not Provided</td><td>S — D365 F&amp;O fully supports subcontracting in production through subcontracted routing operations with automatic vendor PO creation.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R64</td><td>Not Provided</td><td>S — D365 F&amp;O has comprehensive production order status lifecycle (Created, Estimated, Scheduled, Released, Started, RAF, Ended).</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>R69</td><td>Not Provided</td><td>M (split) — Standard parts estimation from BOM library is S. Autodesk integration for new products requires custom API development (M).</td></tr>

        <h2>7. Explicit Risk Notes</h2>
        <div class="high-risk">
            <ul>
<li>7 requirements have no availability code. Per the RFP Instructions tab, &#x27;Items that are not addressed by the Vendor\&#x27;s response will be assumed as not available or not supported.&#x27; This creates significant contractual risk.</li><li>3 items marked as &#x27;S&#x27; (Standard) may be overstated. D365 F&amp;O Production Control provides operations and scheduling but some described features (checklists, team leader assignments, specific dashboard formats) may require Asset Management module, workflow customization, or Power BI development.</li><li>The Factory Operations section (R4-R39) contains the highest concentration of risk. Many requirements describe specialized manufacturing workflows (checklists, team management, AutoCAD integration, area-based calculations) that go beyond standard Production Control.</li><li>MRP (R42-R49), Capacity Planning (R52-R59), and Routings (R104-R119) sections are well-answered and accurately reflect D365 F&amp;O capabilities.</li><li>Manufacturing Orders section (R62-R101) is mostly well-answered but has critical gaps at R63 (outsourcing), R64 (status choices), and R69 (Autodesk estimation) that must be addressed before submission.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>8. Verification Gaps</h2>
        <div class="risk-note">
            <ul>
<li>R22 (Small Pieces list track): Requirement is ambiguous (&#x27;Not Clear&#x27;). Cannot verify without client clarification on what constitutes &#x27;small pieces&#x27; tracking vs. standard inventory item tracking.</li><li>R69 (Estimation linked to Autodesk): Complex requirement spanning standard estimation and external CAD integration. The Autodesk integration scope needs definition before a proper availability code can be assigned.</li><li>R36 (Check in/out with area/duration calculations): The specific calculation formulas (paint area per part, laser cut time per meter per thickness) cannot be verified as standard without examining D365 F&amp;O route operation formula capabilities in detail.</li><li>R109 (Overhead prorate by project size): The exact mechanism for project-size-based overhead proration needs validation against D365 F&amp;O costing sheet capabilities.</li>
